Additionally, Laxus uses some resources you should be familiar with if you want to make PR's:

Resource | Description
-------- | ------------
[The Kotlin Programming Language](https://kotlinlang.org/) | Laxus is written in 100% Kotlin.
[Postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) | Storing data for various functions.
[Discord API Documentation](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) | Documentation of the Discord API.
[HOCON Configuration](https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) | Used for all configuration files.

As a final note on the codebase and usage, this is *not* a standardized library, removal
of functions, or entire APIs/resources is not only to be expected, **it is guaranteed**.
